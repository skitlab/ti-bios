Purpose: 


    The legacy example shows how to build legacy (DSP/BIOS 5.00) source
    using the legacy support in DSP/BIOS 6.00. DSP/BIOS 6.00 supports all 
    the 'C' APIs of DSP/BIOS 5.00.

    This example is the legacy version of the mutex example which use BIOS 6.00
    APIs.
    
    This example has its own BIOS configuration script. This configuration
    script shows how to configure the legacy portion of DSP/BIOS 6.00.

    An important thing to note is that the path to the legacy header files
    <sysbios_install_dir>/packages/ti/bios/include is required. This include
    path gets added to the compiler.opt file when --bios5 option is
    passed to configuro.
    
    The BIOS configuration package must be built before building the legacy 
    example.  Use the makefile in ./<platform_dir> to build the legacy 
    example. If using CCS build depend.pjt first before building legacy.pjt
    in the ./<platform_dir> subdirectory.

Expected output:
	
    See legacy.k file.
