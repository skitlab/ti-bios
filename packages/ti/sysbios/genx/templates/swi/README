Purpose: 

    The swi example shows how to use the ti.sysbios.knl.Swi module. It 
    demonstrates how the various Swi APIs work.

    The DSP/BIOS configuration script for this example is located in the 
    ../common directory.  It is therefore necessary to build the 
    ../common/<platform_dir> subdirectory before building the swi example. 
    
    The ../common/<platform_dir> subdirectory can be built using the makefile 
    or the depend.pjt present at ../common/<platform_dir>. 
    The swi example can be built using the makefile or swi.pjt file located 
    in the ./<platform_dir> subdirectory.

Expected output:
	
    See swi.k file.
