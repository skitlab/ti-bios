Purpose: 

    The clock example shows how to use the ti.sysbios.knl.Clock module to
    create one-shot and periodic Clock Instances. Clock Instances are 
    essentially functions that run after a certain number of Clock ticks.
    
    The DSP/BIOS configuration script for this example is located in the 
    ../common directory. It is therefore necessary to build the 
    ../common/<platform_dir> subdirectory before building the clock example. 
    
    The ../common/<platform_dir> subdirectory can be built using the makefile 
    or the depend.pjt present at ../common/<platform_dir>. 
    The clock example can be built using the makefile or clock.pjt file located 
    in the ./<platform_dir> subdirectory.

Expected output:
	
    See clock.k file.
