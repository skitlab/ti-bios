Purpose: 

    The event example shows how to use the ti.sysbios.knl.Event module.
    The ti.sysbios.knl.Event module solves the "Wait on Multiple" problem.
    In this example a reader task waits on several events. It needs to wake
    up when events with Ids Event_Id_0 and Event_Id_1 occur or Event_Id_2
    occurs. The ti.sysbios.knl.Event module provides an Event_pend() API that 
    allows a task to specify an AND mask and an OR mask. These masks determine
    which event(s) must occur before returning from Event_pend().
    
    In this example the event related to Event_Id_0 is posted by a Clock
    Instance using a call to Event_post(). This is an example of Explicit
    posting of events.
    Event_Id_1 is posted from within a Semaphore Instance. This is an example
    of Implicit posting of events. This is useful when a task needs to wait on 
    a semaphore and an event which is explicitly posted.
    Event_id_2 is posted from within a Mailbox Instance. This is also an example 
    of Implicit posting of events.

    The DSP/BIOS configuration script for this example is located in the 
    ../common directory. It is therefore necessary to build the 
    ../common/<platform_dir> subdirectory before building the event example. 
    The ../common/<platform_dir> subdirectory can be built using the makefile or 
    the depend.pjt present at ../common/<platform_dir>. 
    The event example can be built using the makefile or event.pjt file located 
    in the ./<platform_dir> subdirectory.

Expected output:
	
    See event.k file.
